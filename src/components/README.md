## Kinda notes

I'm planning to implement Atomic Design, but I've done that many times using Tailwindcss and now we are using Material UI as the main CSS library. So, I think it's not the best option to implement Atomic Design, because MUI provides a lot Atom and Molecule components.

Instead Atomic Design, I do mixed approach here, one of them is mimic the Headless UI API for using components.

```
// Example:
<CustomModal.PokedexDetail {...props} />
```

Organizing and namin the components is kinda of experiments too, sorry for that :)
